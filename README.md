## ensemble_amazon
The [Amazon.com - Employee Access Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/amazon-employee-access-challenge) 
was a large competition held on Kaggle in 2013. I was in it (finished 73/1687) however, this is not the code I used.
This code is a refactoring of most of the code and models in [ensemble_amazon](https://github.com/kaz-Anova/ensemble_amazon), 
written by kazAnova a data scientist, fellow Kaggle competitor and author of [StackNet](https://github.com/kaz-Anova/StackNet).
